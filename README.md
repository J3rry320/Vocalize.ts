# Vocalize.ts

Vocalize.ts is a TypeScript library designed to integrate speech recognition and synthesis into web applications. With Vocalize.ts, you can easily set up voice commands that trigger actions and have your app respond by speaking back to the user.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition:** Easily add voice command recognition to your web app.
- **Speech Synthesis:** The app can speak back responses based on recognized commands.
- **Custom TTS Options:** Configure text-to-speech settings for each command action.

# Important Note

**User Event Initialization:** The SpeechSynthesizer initializes and speaks only after a user event (e.g., button click, mouseup) to comply with browser security policies. Otherwise, the library won't be able to talk back to the user. Each command can be recognized, and the callback can be called, but without the TTS feature.

## Motivation

I created Vocalize.ts to simplify the process of adding voice interactions to web applications. Many existing libraries are either too complex or don't provide straightforward integration with speech synthesis. Vocalize.ts aims to bridge this gap by offering a minimal setup and focusing on ease of use.

## Installation

You can install Vocalize.ts via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install vocalize.ts
```

or

```bash
yarn add vocalize.ts
```

## Usage

Here’s a basic example of how to use Vocalize.ts:

```typescript
import { Vocalize } from "vocalize.ts";

// Create a new instance of Vocalize
const vocalize = new Vocalize({
  recognitionOptions: {
    lang: "en-US",
    continuous: false,
    interimResults: false,
  },
  ttsOptions: {
    volume: 1,
    rate: 1,
    pitch: 1,
  },
  presetMood: "happy",
  onCommandRecognized: (phrase) => {
    console.log(`Command recognized: ${phrase}`);
  },
  onCommandUnrecognized: (phrase) => {
    console.log(`Command not recognized: ${phrase}`);
  },
  onError: (error) => {
    console.error(`Speech recognition error: ${error.message}`);
  },
});

// Register commands
vocalize.registerCommands([
  {
    phrase: "hello world",
    action: () => ({
      speak: true,
      text: "Hello, world!",
      options: {
        rate: 1.2,
      },
      callback: () => {
        console.log("Hello World Action Called");
      },
    }),
  },
]);

// Start listening for commands
vocalize.startListening();
```

## Key Concepts

- **User Event Initialization:** Ensure the library is initialized after a user event (e.g., button click) to comply with browser policies.
- **Command Registration**: Register commands and their corresponding actions.
- **Speech Synthesis**: Configure how the app speaks back using TTS options.

## Documentation

### Class: `Vocalize`

The `Vocalize` class provides methods to integrate speech recognition and synthesis into your web application.

#### Constructor

```typescript
constructor(options: VoiceCommandOptions = {})
```

**Parameters:**

- `options`: An object to configure the instance with the following properties:
  - `recognitionOptions` (optional): Options for the SpeechRecognition API (see [SpeechRecognition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition)).
  - `ttsOptions` (optional): Default options for text-to-speech (see [SpeechSynthesis API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis)).
  - `onCommandRecognized` (optional): Callback function that is called when a command is recognized.
  - `onCommandUnRecognized` (optional): Callback function that is called when a command is not recognized.
  - `onError` (optional): Callback function that is called when an error occurs during speech recognition.
  - `presetMood` (optional): This option allows you to configure the text-to-speech (TTS) settings based on predefined mood settings. Look below to find the default settings

#### Methods

1.  **`registerCommands(commands: Command[]): void`**

    Registers a list of commands that the library will recognize.

    **Parameters:**

    - `commands`: An array of `Command` objects, where each object has:
      - `phrase`: The command phrase to recognize.
      - `action`: A function that returns an object with the following properties:
        - `speak` (optional): A boolean indicating whether the app should speak back.
        - `text` (optional): The text to be spoken if `speak` is true.
        - `options` (optional): TTS options specific to this command.
        - `callback` (optional): A function to be called when the command is executed.

    **Example:**

```typescript
vocalize.registerCommands([
  {
    phrase: "hello world",
    action: () => ({
      speak: true,
      text: "Hello, world!",
      options: { rate: 1.2 },
      callback: () => console.log("Hello World Action Called"),
    }),
  },
]);
```

2.  **`startListening(): void`**

    Starts listening for speech input.

    **Usage:**

    ```typescript
    vocalize.startListening();
    ```

3.  **`stopListening(): void`**

    Stops listening for speech input.

    **Usage:**

    ```typescript
    vocalize.stopListening();
    ```

4.  **`setTTSOptions(options: SpeechOptions): void`**

    Sets the default text-to-speech options for the instance.

    **Parameters:**

    - `options`: An object with TTS settings:
      - `volume` (optional): Volume level (0.0 to 1.0).
      - `rate` (optional): Speech rate (0.1 to 10).
      - `pitch` (optional): Speech pitch (0 to 2).

    **Example:**

### Preset Mood Configuration

This object contains predefined TTS settings for various moods:

```json

  "happy": { "volume": 1.0, "rate": 1.2, "pitch": 1.5 },
  "calm": { "volume": 0.8, "rate": 0.9, "pitch": 1.0 },
  "sad": { "volume": 0.7, "rate": 0.8, "pitch": 0.8 },
  "angry": { "volume": 1.0, "rate": 1.1, "pitch": 1.3 },
  "surprised": { "volume": 1.0, "rate": 1.2, "pitch": 1.4 },
  "neutral": { "volume": 1.0, "rate": 1.0, "pitch": 1.0 }
}
```

**Note:** If the `presetMood` provided does not match any of the predefined moods, the library will use the default TTS settings specified in `ttsOptions`.
